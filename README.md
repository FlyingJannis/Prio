Prio gives you structure for your everyday life as well as for your job and does it as efficiently and quickly as possible!

The app breaks the big problem: "Order this list of 30 items, according to their importance/quality or other criterium".

down into many small problems: "Which of these 2 elements do you find more important/better based on your gut feeling?"

The app uses cleverly posed “either/or” questions to try to solve your originally very confusing problem elegantly and as quickly as possible!

★ The ability to create an unlimited number of prios with an unlimited number of items!
